1. SCOPING

20.10.2017
Scope is the development of an app to support health visitors nursing patients with
social anxieties. The app shouldn't contain any typical functionality of a Clinic Information
System, furthermore its purpose should be only to image the treatment correlated to 
social anxieties.

2. RESEARCH

Actually we have little knowledge of this particular field of nursing. Thus, besides
getting information about these kinds of disorder, we need to conduct an interview
with a professional.

For this interview, the following professionals were considered and contacted:
- a friend of kybup1, Psychologist
- an uncle of meiej3, Psychologist
- a friend of petim1, professional carer/social pedagogy
- three home care institutions specialized on social anxieties

Questions got carried together (see interview-process.txt)

3. SYNTHESIZE

kybup1, meiej3, petim1 and gfels6 called and asked one of the possible interview partners each

26.10.2017
We documented the information of the three interviews.
