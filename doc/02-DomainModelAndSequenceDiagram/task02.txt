For your application, design:
1. a UML domain model covering the main classes
  ▶ incl. association, inheritance, and aggregation relations
  ▶ observe the general modeling guidelines and make use of Responsibility
  Driven Design (RDD) or use CRC-Cards as a tool

2. based on your domain model, create two UML sequence diagrams, one each
for the following situations (each should be non-trivial)
  ▶ when the user updates some specific information
  ▶ when the system alerts the user about some specific event

3. if necessary, refine your UML class model to include the attributes and
  operations needed for your sequence diagrams.
